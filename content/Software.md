On this page you can find links to the most recent version of the operando potential and time resolved spectroscopy software compatible with the hardware lists. All the code is written in labVIEW so ideally you will need a labVIEW licence to run it. If you would like a .exe file I may be able to provide this but I cannot guarantee compatibility with your system or troubleshoot any issues. I have found that keeping the code in labview is a the best compromise to ensure compatibility! You can also find a link to my github page for analysis scripts (note on 2022/08/2: these will be better organised in the near future - I am currently drafting a paper to most easily disseminate how they work). You can also find a link the final version of the TA/PIA code - note I am now focusing on simpler instrument designs so no longer support this software.
