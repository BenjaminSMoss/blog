Title: "The open source spectropscopy project: advanced  measurments and modern analysis made quick and simple."
Content: Hi! Welcome to my page. I am a spectroscopist working at Imperial College London on renewable energy conversion technologies. I also develop and improve operando, time resolved spectroscopies for the Durrant group. From this experience, I realised that many ‘specialist techniques’, such as pump probe spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry are widely inaccessible due to idiosyncratic design and implementation rather than inherent complexity. This means that researchers with great new materials or amazing ideas often have to use more rudimentary instrumentation
