On this page you can find a link to the operando spectroscopy code. In the near futrure you will also be able to find a manual for how to operate the code - it should be reasonably straghtforward after installing the drivers and sub VIs for IVIUM/Andor/ocean.  A future manual will cover these but in the mean time please contact me if you have any problems or questions! Note on 2022/08/2: The code will be simplified for easier reading and duplicate dependences will be removed in the near future!
